        <p>
          I am an enthusiastic software development engineer with over 5 years
          of experience in software engineering. Proficient in JavaScript and
          TypeScript, various front-end frameworks, and libraries, with React
          and related frameworks as my tools of choice for various projects.<br /><br />I
          have always been a supporter of data-driven business development and I
          seek to help people make their own business decisions by representing
          big data in a simple, readable and understandable forms. I am always
          curious about new tools, languages and libraries I could add to my
          arsenal.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to visit my personal

        <ul>
          <li>
            I am very proud of my work as a teacher for ITBootcamp where myself
            and another software developer were responsible for teaching ReactJS
            to a class of 26 pupils. Before their work with us they had
            education in HTML CSS and JavaScript. Most of them found gainfull
            employment shortly after finishing the program. In adition to
            ReactJS, I am an instructor for HTML, CSS, JavaSscript and
            Typescript.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            As I saw a need for a development of an in-house solution for
            tracking the knowledge progress of fellow developers, I recommended
            the entire app to the management and my implementation was approved.
            So I started developing the entire app from the ground up, which
            also server as a knowledge repositorium for various topics - React,
            Angular, JS, Node etc. All curriculums were curated by senior
            developers. Over time I was assigned developers to assist on the
            project, and while we had many issues, it was ultimately a great
            success, which I am very proud of.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            As a part of a great team I helped develop an in-house library for
            other developers to use. It was for a large international air
            company, and the solution required development of React components
            that could be just called from the library and customised through
            props.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Working with another great team on a complete web solution for a US
            medical company was one of my greatest trials. It included
            multi-form flows where a lot of the information sent and received
            depended on various inputs from the user, as well as a complex
            e-mailing system.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            I've had a pleasure on working on a very complex project that
            involved multiple custom machines. My role on the project was
            extending current functionality from handing a single 1-1
            machine-to-user connection to handle up to 6 machines to a single
            client, as well as adding new features to the project.
