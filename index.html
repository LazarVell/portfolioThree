Before their work with us they had education in HTML CSS and JavaScript. Most of them found gainfull employment shortly after finishing the program. In adition to React.js, I am an instructor for HTML, CSS, JavaSscript and Typescript.</li><br><li>As I saw a need for a development of an in-house solution for tracking the knowledge progress of fellow developers, I recommended the entire app to the management and my implementation was approved. So I started developing the entire app from the ground up, which also server as a knowledge repositorium for various topics - React, Angular, JS, Node etc. All curriculums were curated by senior developers. Over time I was assigned developers to assist on the project, and while we had many issues, it was ultimately a great success, which I am very proud of.</li><br><li>As a part of a great team I helped design an in-house library for other developers to use. It was for a large international air company, and the solution required development of React components that could be just called from the library and customised through props.</li><br><li>Working with another great team on a complete web solution for a US medical company was one of my greatest trials. It included multi-form flows where a lot of the information sent and received depended on various inputs from the user, as well as a complex e-mailing system.</li></ul></section><blockquote><h2>Contact me:</h2><p><img src="assets/images/e-mail-icon.png" alt="e-mail-icon"/> <a id="email" href="javascript:;" onclick='navigator.clipboard.writeText("laza992@gmail.com")'>laza992@gmail.com</a></p><p><img src="assets/images/linkedin-logo.png" alt="e-mail-icon"/> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lazar-velickovic/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a></p></blockquote></main><script type="module" src="/script.js"></script></body></html>
